# Youtube comments sentiment analysis

## Description

This project is a simple sentiment analysis on youtube comments. It scrap the comments from a youtube video, then execute a sentiment analysis on the comments.

It works with the youtube API, so you need to create a project on the google console and get an API key.

The results are not very accurate, but it's a good start for me to understand NLP, to improve the results, i could use a pre-trained model like 'Perspective' from Google.
